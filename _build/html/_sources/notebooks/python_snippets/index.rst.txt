Python Snippets
========================

Great analysis often comes down to small, reusable patterns: efficient loops, clear visualizations, and handy utilities. This chapter collects **practical Python snippets** that support experimentation, prototyping, and day-to-day productivity. They're not about theory, but about building habits that make every project smoother.
