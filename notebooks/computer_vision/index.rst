Computer Vision
====================

Vision is a primary human sense, and machines that see can transform industries. This chapter looks at the **foundations of image understanding**: how to process pixels, extract features, and build pipelines that enable recognition and interpretation. From simple filters to building blocks for deep vision systems, the focus is on intuition for representing and manipulating visual data.
